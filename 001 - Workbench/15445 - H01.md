Q9:
> If you use the `date_year` flag from `release_info`, the result may turn out to be weird, for the area of a specific `release` may be varied. This flag has been  removed from answer cause it not meet the requirements of the question.

> It can articulate more clearly if you use the criteria of `ASCII` with `INNER JOIN`, but it shows no distinction if you use `FROM` and `WHERE` correctly to eliminate the duplicated parts.
