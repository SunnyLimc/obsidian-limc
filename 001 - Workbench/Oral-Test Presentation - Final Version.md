Excellent

Another point I want to illustrate is that.

I wants the definition to be more specific.

I'd like to propose a new term __ .



Do you agree with that the economy has a big impact on our life?

I did a little search on Wikipedia. The exact definition of economics something hard for me to remember. But what I find interesting is the fact that economics is divided into the different parts of micro and macro. And it's definitely two different parts. Sounds pretty hardcore, doesn't it? 

There is a vivid example you may aware of, with the outbreak of the epidemic, fewer and fewer jobs are open to market. It is more difficult for students to find jobs. It demonstrate that economics invisibly did impact on everything.

**So, what the best practice to solve this dilemma problems?** The popular choice for undergraduate student to prevent from "side effect" is prepare for postgraduate examination. And that is a significant question what government need to trade-off between to prevent outbreak or to keep market open.


Do you think you're psychologically healthy?

Psychology is a popular field nowadays. With a boom development of society, a large crowd of people are suffered from mental illness. That sounds pretty unintelligible, doesn't it? But, fact shows that keeps a good attitudes towards life is the significant for remedy.

Actually, I did a little search on WEB, it shows genetic roots are a crucial factor impact to human's mental and characteristic. Many symptoms are inherited from parent, and compare with the old society, those traits are unable to accommodate complicated social life currently. So, people with this symptoms are easy to get discrimination.

**It's a coincidence, actually.** There happened to be a girl in my class who was suspected of ASD (specific as autism, the people mostly can not socialize). With a deeper search, I finally understand that there was a crowd of people, theirs behavior is not up to themself. But most of people don't know about that and usually discriminate against them. And it's the large lack of ours education and social system, I think.


Do you think globalization is actually a good thing?

Globalization is a popular field nowadays. With a boom development of the world, a large crowd of industries emerged. It involved countless opportunities of challenges. That sounds pretty complicated, doesn't it? But, in the landmark of the 100 years of globalization, progress seems to be going less smoothly than expected.

Actually, I did a little search on WEB, *it shows that capital are a crucial factor impact to the globalization of economic and culture.* The wave of globalization has mostly cause from capital transfer, but as time goes on, countries that dominate globalization are getting less and less profit, so peoples are trying to prevent from that.

**I personally think**, for our country, we have the dominant position in commodity exports and capital imports, it did give us a big advantage through the globalization flow. There's no best practice for solving this unstoppable problem. What we can do is take one step at a time and make sensible decision.


Do you think it easy to master a language?

Language acquisition is a commonplace topic. With the spread of culture and knowledge, the trend of learning language is becoming more and more popular. That sounds pretty obvious, doesn't it? But many people found difficulty in language learning. It seems a correct approach and understanding has a higher priority than endeavor.

As for me, I agree with that language is quite tough to master with. It's significant for you to have a ponder. If you are lacking of an intense purpose, the desire to grasp a language will dropping dramatically.

**And then I think there are two things that may helps to your guys.** the first point is, watching series on TV or whatever else helps you to understand the language better. Moreover is starts conversations in English, you need to use English interactively and practice your own speaking skills. **I want to illustrate an effective way I have tried**. To speak English articles loudly is one of simplest way to promote your skill.


Do you think celebrating birthdays is an important activity every year?

We must admit that different cultures celebrate their festivals in different ways. 

Birthday celebration is a tradition ceremony in my hometown, Guangzhou. It's nothing special that we will hold a birthday party for people over 60 every five years. The goal is for the elderly to feel cared for and did a special health blessing.

**I am quite the opposite / although** I find this kind of ceremony very boring. But in terms of the reality situations, the issue of taking care of the old people for our younger has always been a problem. So we need pay more attention to the elderly rather than complaining.


Does your parents smoking?

Anti-smoking is a commonplace topic. With the spread of environment conscious and healthy awareness, the trend of smoking is becoming less popular. But there's still maintains a large base of smoker. Smoking kills nearly a million people a year. That sounds pretty horrible, doesn't it? Taking effective measures is imminent.

As for me, my parents are strongly opposed to smoking. My father used to be a smoker, nearly a pack of cigarette he consume a day. But in the purpose of giving me a healthy circumstance to grow up, he had began a two-year journey to quit smoking. To be honest, he is really a role model that a people deserve to be named as "parent".

So, it's sufficient to say that we make a progress on anti-smoking? Not necessarily, although the trade of traditional cigarette are declined, but nicotine comes in a different form in e-cigarette which is popular among young people. Foshan is in the forefront of the country, but that still far from the goal. If everybody such as our parents can set a good example and get cigarette out of taxes system, a healthy public environment will emerge.


Do you think your mind is optimized for memory things?

Memory is a commonplace topic. With the spread of culture and technology, the trend of improve memory is becoming more and more popular. That sounds pretty awesome, doesn't it? But fact shows that with the increasing pressure and content of the younger  need to confront. it seems a correct approach of memory is significant than endeavor.

As for me, I admit that it's really tough for me to master memorize. Memories often fly away from my mind. An outline impression of your brain may certainly helpful to you. Memory is divide into two parts, working memory and long-term memory. Information firstly be handled and processed in working memory, and then they're sent to long-term memory. It's make sense to promote your abilities by improving your working memory.

**I want to illustrate an effective way I have tried**. If we treat contents as blocks, the average working memory for normal person is between 4 and 8 chunks. Break big chunks into small, bit-sized pieces then focus one or two of them before moving on. You just have to focus on the present, ignore the rest, repeat small pieces of chunk in order to bring it into long-term memory. 


Do you still maintains the friendship with your old classmates?

Friendship is a commonplace topic. There's a word our parents often mentioned, "relationship" is crucial to success. A precious friendship may help us over difficulties and sorrow. Therefore, it is important to build up a correct understanding of friendship.

As for me, I admit that it's really tough for me to make or maintain friendship. I'm not good at dealing with the problems happened between the daily company of friends. But, Even so, I think it's significant for you to have a ponder. If some guys one of you are lacking of honesty and sincerity, it's hard for you to make friends.

**I want to give you another piece of advice that I found on the Internet.** One of the important fact is create and capitalize on time together. Strong relationships do require staying in touch and spending meaningful time together. So, at the very least, check in with your girlfriend when you can. (I think girl friend is kind of friend)


Do you have a specific goal of who you want to be?

Success is a commonplace topic. There are a pile of successful chicken soup over the Internet. Some of you may bored of it. But have you actually think of what your definition of successful, or what's your goal in your long life. Have you pay your endeavor to achieve it? This may be difficult to answer, but I'd like to hear some of your insights.

As for me, I admit that it's hard for me to show my long-term goals instantly. What regret me most is I'm not working hard enough to reach my milestone. But since college, I try to make lists to accomplish my short-term goals. In fact, I find out myself is easy to delay things. Even so, a good news is I'm currently doing my best to achieve my first landmark.

**Can I just say something? I think** Purpose is the premise of successful, If you are lacking of an intense purpose, the desire to reach your target will dropping dramatically. Just focus on what you are interested in, and then keep working on it. Remember: "Hard work will not always get you to the top, but should get you pretty near".


Do you think bike sharing really gets your life better?

Bike-sharing is no longer a new topic. With the difficult for people to move around the city because of increased traffic congestion, bike-sharing emerged. Although bike-sharing has lost its popularity in recent years, but it did really give us a reliable time estimation and convenient for people travelling shorter distances.

As for me, the emergence of shared bikes gave me the power to regain control of time. With bike-sharing, I found that I could reach my destination twice or more as fast on the last mile compared to walking, people always says that "time is money", bike sharing has countless advantages in this aspect.

**I have another particular opinion.** This is an innovation that helps the city get its citizens around more effectively and it helps the environment at the same time. The bike sharing system current running has demonstrated having an ecological compatible economy is possible.
