- how much entropy is needed depends on your security model
	- entropy: $\log{_2}(possibility)$, with coin flip, the possibility is 2

- hash functions
	- non-invertible - only input to output
	- collision resistance - hard to find two input cause same output - differentiate different identifier
	- fix size output - squeeze big input
	- sha1(bytes) to 160 bits
