a vector can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number

in linear algebra perspective, a vector always will be rooted at the origin(原点).

- the addition (sum) : move the second one's tail to first one's tip, and also keep the second one keep the original orientation, and draw a new vector from the tail of the first one to where the tip of the second one. 
	- you can treat vector as a orientation-specified movement in coordinate
	- or an addition on the number line. (treat x and y axes as two separate number line)

 - the scalar-multiplication
	 - treat as scaling a vector with a scalars(标量)
	 - as the same as mentioned above (treat x .. as two separate number line)
