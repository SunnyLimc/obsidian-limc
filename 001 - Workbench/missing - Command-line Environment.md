> use `most` to get a better `$PAGER` experience

- manage processes
	- process's output will be ignored with using `nohup`, and will ignore `hangup` signal (e.g. program will still running after closing the terminal)
	- use `^Z` to suspend job, and use `bg %[jobid]` to send it with `continue` signal and they will keep running in background (you can check the list with `jobs`)
		- something very similar: `fg`, recover to foreground and reattach to your output
	- add `&` and your prompt will not be took over by program
	- send any signal to process `kill -[SIG] %[jobid]`

- Multiplex - `tmux`, keeping execution although received `hangup` signal
	- conception
		- Session
			- Windows
				- Panes
	- `^b + d` detach from session
		- `tmux a` re-attach to that session
	- `tmux new -t [name]` start a new session
		- `tmux a -t [name]` to re-attach
	- `tmux ls` to list sessions
	- window switcher
		- `^b + c` create a new window
		- `^b + p` previous tab
		- `^b + n` next window
		- `^b + [num]` to specific window
		- `^d` close a pane (if close the last pane on the last window, it will eventually close the session)
	- panes management
		- `^b + "` split window horizontally
			- `^b + %` split window vertically
		- `^b + [arrowKey]` switch between panes
		- `^b + space` rearrange panes
		- `^b + z` to zoom-in a pane, and retaped it to zoom-out
